Founded in 1931, Ortigas Land transformed vast tracts of undeveloped land into a thriving and progressive industrial, commercial and residential center. The original Manda-loyon covers an area of 4.033 hectares and is currently home to some of today's notable commercial, residential and educational institutions.



Ortigas Land, one of the pioneers of the Philippine real estate industry, has perfected the art of living, working and relaxing by conceiving and building master-planned developments that over time have become thriving communities - examples of excellence in the Philippine real estate industry.
