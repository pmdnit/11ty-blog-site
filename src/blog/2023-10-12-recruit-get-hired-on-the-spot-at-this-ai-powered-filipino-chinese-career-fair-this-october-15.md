Bossjob, the chat-first career platform for professional hiring in Southeast Asia (SEA), is set to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the career fair scene when it co-organizes with Philippine Dragon Media Network the 2nd Filipino-Chinese Job Fair 2023 on October 15 at the SMX Convention Center Manila, Pasay City.



The job fair will feature around 70 top Philippine and local Chinese companies from different industries. With the extensive media reach of the Philippine Dragon Media Network, the job fair promises to be an excellent opportunity for companies to widen their brand exposure to the Fil-Chi market.



“We are excited to host this job fair and provide opportunities for individuals who are seeking employment. We believe that this job fair will not only benefit job seekers but also the companies who are looking for talented and qualified workers,” said Peterson Ang, event organizer and editor-in-chief of the Philippine Dragon Media Network.



One of the main highlights of the one-day event is the job-matching sessions. These sessions aim to connect companies with locals, Fil-Chi multilingual professionals, and fresh graduates, facilitating seamless candidate acquisition on the spot through the platform’s AI-hiring app.



Bossjob, which some investors dub the SEA version of China’s BOSS Zhipin and Tianyancha, started in the Philippines in 2018 with its innovative MDD model of “mobile + direct chat + AI-matching,” introducing direct chat into the recruitment scene.



Kimberly Chen, Country Manager of Bossjob, expressed, “Bossjob has always been at the forefront of integrating technology with human potential towards making the recruitment process more personalized, swift, and efficient. With our AI-driven platform, we aim to connect the right talent with the right opportunities instantly.”



“Co-organizing the 2nd Filipino-Chinese Job Fair this year is a testament to our vision of reshaping the job market dynamics in Southeast Asia, and we’re excited to be a catalyst for change, especially at a time when the world needs it the most,” Chen added.



The Philippine-born recruitment platform, which recently raised a $5 million seed fund, reached a milestone when it garnered over 2.9 million registered users in the Philippines. After launching in Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia, Bossjob plans to venture to Hong Kong in the third quarter of the year and aims to reach over 30 million users in Southeast Asia by 2026. As part of its efforts to expand its global market, it has started offering free services this year.



Moreover, attendees will have the chance to hear from the joining exhibitors who will serve as speakers at the event, including Shell, Asticom Group of Companies, Square and Circle Properties, Magic Cube, SEO Hacker, Lazada, and Manulife Financial Plans. Successful registrants of the event will also be eligible for exclusive giveaway and raffles.



The Filipino-Chinese Job Fair is a testament to the Philippine Dragon Media Network’s commitment to promoting economic growth and Fil-Chi exchanges in the Philippines.
